# Face Recognition for Criminal Detection

This project is a cutting-edge Face Recognition System developed using Python and powered by Artificial Intelligence. The application assists in criminal detection by identifying suspects from uploaded images and matching them against a database of previous records or FIRs (First Information Reports).

## Key Features

     🕵️‍♂️ Suspect Identification: Recognizes faces from uploaded images and checks for matches in the database.

     📋 Detailed Reports: Generates reports containing details such as:

          Suspect’s Name

          Years Spent in Prison

          Case Details

     🗂️ Database Integration: Uses a structured database to store and retrieve criminal data efficiently.

     🔍 Search by Date: Fetch data for specific time ranges using the admin panel.
